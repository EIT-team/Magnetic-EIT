# Magnetic-EIT-
A set of classes and functions to be used in conjunction with EIDORS software in Matlab to deal with magnetic field measurements combined with EIT.
Currently, these classes and functions are suitable for problems concerning the forward problem for the magnetic field of MD-EIT. The software is only compatible with 3-D FEMs with tetrahedral elements. This software assumes prior competency using EIDORS with Netgen for EIT forward problem calculations. 

Instructions:

1. Install the EIDORS software from http://eidors3d.sourceforge.net/

2. Install Netgen from https://sourceforge.net/projects/netgen-mesher/files/netgen-mesher/5.3/ (if not already installed with EIDORS). If using Mac OSX then the instructions on this page: https://sourceforge.net/p/eidors3d/mailman/message/35520646/ may be necessary to get Netgen to work.

3. Download the 'Classes' and 'Functions' folders from this Github Repository. 

4. Open Matlab and run the EIDORS startup procedure.

5. Make sure both the 'Classes' and 'Functions' folders are on your Matlab path. 

6. Download 'Tutorial_1' from this Github Repository and follow the steps to see how the software works.

7. Open a new script and start using the software! 



Please have a look at the documentation for the functions/methods for explanations of their functionality. For any problems, bugs or queries please email me at kai.mason@ucl.ac.uk
