# Magnetic-EIT-
A set of functions to be used in conjunction with EIDORS software/structures in Matlab to deal with magnetic field measurements combined with EIT.
Currently these functions are suitable for calculation of the forward solution for the magnetic field in 3-D FEMs with tetrahedral elements.
